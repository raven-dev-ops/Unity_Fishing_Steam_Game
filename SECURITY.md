# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| `1.x` | Yes |
| `<1.0` | Best effort / no guarantee |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
1. Prefer GitHub private vulnerability reporting (`Security` tab -> `Report a vulnerability`).
2. If private reporting is unavailable, open a limited GitHub issue requesting a secure contact channel without posting exploit details.
3. Include:
   - affected commit/tag/version
   - impact summary
   - reproduction steps or proof-of-concept
   - suggested mitigation (if available)

Do not post full exploit details publicly before remediation is coordinated.

## Response Targets
- Acknowledgement: within 3 business days.
- Initial triage outcome: within 7 business days.
- Remediation timeline: based on severity and release risk.

## Coordinated Disclosure
- Please allow time for triage, patch development, and release rollout before public disclosure.
- We will coordinate disclosure timing and advisories after a fix is available or compensating controls are documented.

## Internal Handling Reference
- Maintainer workflow reference: `docs/SECURITY_RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md`
