# Art Specs (MVP)

## MVP Rules
- Use readable silhouettes at 1080p.
- Prioritize function over detail for first pass assets.
- Keep art directional coherence with nautical fantasy tone.

## File Naming

- Examples:
  - `fish_cod_common_v01`

  - `hook_lvl2_barbed_v01`

## Pivot Guidance
- Fish sprites: pivot at center.
- Ships: pivot at center-bottom.
- Hooks: pivot at top where line attaches.

## Export Defaults
- Texture format: PNG.
- Source files: keep PSD/ASE in source archive.
