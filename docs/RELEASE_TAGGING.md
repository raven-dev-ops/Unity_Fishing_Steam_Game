# Release Tagging and Build Upload

## Tagging
- Use semantic version tag: `v1.0.0` for launch.
- Annotated tag preferred.

## Steps
1. Confirm release branch is green.
2. Create/update release notes.
3. Tag commit (`v1.0.0`).
4. Build Windows release.
5. Upload via SteamPipe.
6. Attach build metadata/checksums to release notes.
