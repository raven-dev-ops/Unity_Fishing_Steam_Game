# Keyboard UX Audit

## Areas
- Main Menu
- Settings, Profile, and Pause menus
- Harbor interactables and shops
- Fishing controls and pause flow

## Audit Checklist
- Initial focus is visible when each screen opens.
- Arrow/WASD navigation does not get stuck.
- Enter confirms the currently focused option.
- Esc consistently backs out or pauses.
- Focus aura follows active selection without jitter.
- No keyboard-only dead ends (must be able to recover and continue).

## Severity Tags
- `BLOCKER`: Player cannot proceed without mouse.
- `MAJOR`: Core navigation is inconsistent or misleading.
- `MINOR`: Cosmetic issue with no gameplay lock.

## Result Logging
Record scene, key sequence, expected result, actual result, and severity.
